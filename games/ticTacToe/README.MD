This project is a tic-tac-toe game, coded in C++23.
The game can be played in both single-player and multi-player.
The single-player game has a bot that uses a simple yet intelligent algorithm to find a good move.
The bot prioritizes winning, then blocking the opponent from winning, and lastly a normal move.
The multi-player game is to be played with two players.
Both the versions of the game are customizable, with customizable pieces and usernames in multi-player.
